#Pour Me A Drink App

This Single Page App is the final React project for Flatiron School. It was created to be a place where people could browse different drink recipes and upload some of their own. It uses the free Cocktail Database API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to populate the lists of cocktails on the homepage.

##Installation

Fork and clone this repository to your local drive. Then inside the directory run
```
npm start
```
You  will need to fork and clone the repository located at (https://github.com/joannayhs/pour-me-a-drink-backend). Then from inside that directory run 
```
npm start
```

##Usage
Once the frontend and backend are up and running, you can begin using the app. 

To search the database, click on the letters at the top of the homepage. That populates about 20 cocktails at a time. 

Drinks can be saved to the "Favorites" page by clicking either on star icon or by opening the details for that cocktail and hitting the "Add to Favorites" button. They can be removed from favorites in the same  way. 

Users can also add their own drink recipes under the "My Recipes" page. This page will show all the recipes that a user has added and has a link to add recipes. When a user clicks on that link, the Recipe form appears and users can input the necessary information. Users can then save and it will appear in their list of recipes. Users can then open the details of their own recipe and click the "Edit Recipe" link to make changes or the Delete button to remove the recipe entirely. Users can also delete recipes from the edit form.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
